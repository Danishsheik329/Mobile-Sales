# Car Sales Analysis
### 1.	Project Title / Headline
Car Sales Analysis<br>
An interactive dashboard designed to analyze Year-To-Date (YTD) car sales across company, model, engine type, transmission, color, and body style—empowering business users with actionable insights into sales performance, revenue, and customer preferences.

### 2.	Short Description / Purpose
The Car Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report that helps users explore and compare car sales based on company, model, engine type, transmission, color, and body style. The data was collected and prepared using SQL before being visualized in Power BI. The dashboard tracks Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, revenue, and total cars sold, allowing users to compare current performance with last year. This tool helps sales teams, analysts, and car companies understand sales trends, revenue growth, and customer preferences for better business decisions.

### 3.	Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
•	 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
•	 Ms Excel – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
•	 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
•	 SQL (Structured Query Language) – Used to retrieve, filter, and aggregate car sales data from the database before importing it into Power BI.

### 4.	Data Source
The dataset used in this project was taken from Kaggle.
It contains 23,916 rows and 16 columns, providing detailed information about car sales, including company, model, engine type, transmission, color, body style, sale price, and total revenue.


### 5.	Features / Highlights
•	Business Problem
The company lacks a centralized system to monitor Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales performance. As a result, management cannot easily evaluate revenue trends, identify best-selling models, or compare performance with last year to plan effective marketing and production strategies.

•	Goal of the Dashboard
The goal of this dashboard is to monitor Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) performance of sales, revenue, and total cars sold across different dimensions such as company, model, transmission type, and body style. This helps users analyze trends, compare performance, and make informed business decisions.
