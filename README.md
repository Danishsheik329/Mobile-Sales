# Car Sales Analysis
### 1.	Project Title / Headline
Car Sales Analysis<br>
An interactive dashboard designed to analyze Year-To-Date (YTD) car sales across company, model, engine type, transmission, color, and body style—empowering business users with actionable insights into sales performance, revenue, and customer preferences.

### 2.	Short Description / Purpose
The Car Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report that helps users explore and compare car sales based on company, model, engine type, transmission, color, and body style. The data was collected and prepared using SQL before being visualized in Power BI. The dashboard tracks Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, revenue, and total cars sold, allowing users to compare current performance with last year. This tool helps sales teams, analysts, and car companies understand sales trends, revenue growth, and customer preferences for better business decisions.

### 3.	Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
•	 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
•	 Ms Excel – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
•	 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
•	 SQL (Structured Query Language) – Used to retrieve, filter, and aggregate car sales data from the database before importing it into Power BI.

### 4.	Data Source
The dataset used in this project was taken from Kaggle.
It contains 23,916 rows and 16 columns, providing detailed information about car sales, including company, model, engine type, transmission, color, body style, sale price, and total revenue.

Example:
•	Business Problem
The global ski tourism industry generates billions in revenue, yet travelers, tour operators, and analysts often lack an intuitive way to compare resorts across countries. 

Key questions such as:
Which regions offer the most family-friendly or expert-level skiing?
Where is summer skiing available?
What countries have the most well-equipped resorts?
… are difficult to answer quickly with raw data.

•	Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive visual tool that:
Enables users to explore ski resorts globally.
Supports decisions such as vacation planning, regional marketing, or infrastructure investment.
Uncovers trends in terrain, accessibility, and tourism capacity by region and resort.

•	Walkthrough of Key Visuals
-	Key KPIs (Top Left)
Total number of resorts: 499
Resorts with summer skiing: 29
Resorts with night skiing: 204
Child-friendly resorts: 495
Countries covered: 38
Continents represented: 5
-	Continent Filter Panel
An interactive slicer lets users filter all visuals by selected continents, such as Europe or Asia.
-	Top Countries with Most Resorts (Bar Chart)
Bar chart ranks countries like Austria, France, and the U.S. by number of ski resorts.
-	Slopes by Resort (Line Chart)
Displays the distribution of slope types (beginner, intermediate, expert, and total). Helps identify which resorts favor beginners vs. experts.
-	 Resorts by Skill Level (Dual Line Charts)
Two line visuals side by side: one for resorts that cater to beginners, another for experts—allowing skill-level segmentation.
-	Elevation Stats (Grouped Bar Chart)
Compare the highest and lowest elevation points of resorts to understand terrain steepness and potential snow quality.
-	Lift Types by Resort (Stacked Bar Chart)
Stacked bar chart showing:
Gondola lifts
Chair lifts
Surface lifts
Total lifts
This helps users gauge resort infrastructure and capacity.

•	Business Impact & Insights
Marketing Optimization: Travel agencies can use this dashboard to identify key selling points for different demographics (e.g., child-friendly resorts or expert terrain).
Strategic Expansion: Resort developers can spot underdeveloped regions with high potential.
Vacation Planning: Tourists can plan trips based on slope availability, elevation, and terrain difficulty.
Regional Analysis: Governments and tourism bodies can analyze competitiveness by region.
